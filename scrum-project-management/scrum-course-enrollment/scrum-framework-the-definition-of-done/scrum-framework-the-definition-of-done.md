# Excerpt

Scrum Framework: The Definition of Done provides an explanation of how to determine a scrum team's definition of done for user stories and bugs. Having a team agreed upon definition of done it permits a Scum team to know when items are releasable. Within a course titled Scrum Framework: Definition of Done, this linguistic-written-works-of-artz {L.WWoA} provides the five levels of planning, the evolution of product scope, the definition of done in product development, variations of defining done, creating a definition of done, the definition of done and the Sprint goal, and lastly, the definition of done and empiricism.

# [Notes Overview](#notes-overview)
Scrum Framework: The Definition of Done provides an explanation of how to determine a scrum team's definition of done for user stories and bugs. Having a team agreed upon definition of done it permits a Scum team to know when items are releasable. Within a course titled **Scrum Framework: Definition of Done**, this *linguistic-written-works-of-artz {L.WWoA}* provides the five levels of planning, the evolution of product scope, the definition of done in product development, variations of defining done, creating a definition of done, the definition of done and the Sprint goal, and lastly, the definition of done and empiricism.
Currently, I work as a software engineer at Blue Streak Technologies located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana sub-contracted with CGI. As a part of our preparation for refining our objectives for Program Increment 16 of the Puerto Rico Disaster Recovery Project, we are permitted to enroll in an online training course within CGI Academia offered by issuer SkillSoft titled SCRUM Quality, Planning, and Completion: The Definition of Done.
On Wednesday, May 15, 2021, I participated in and completed the online training course offered by SkillSoft and have complied my notes into this *linguistic-written-works-of-artz {L.WWoA}* titled **Scrum Framework: The Definition of Done**. As I study and learn about SCRUM agile methodology and framework to implement projects, I will compile notes into a *linguistic-written-works-of-artz {L.WWoA}* and share them with everyone. Yep-pey :)

# [Five Levels of Planning](#five-levels-of-planning)
## Five Levels
1.	Product Vision
2.	Product Roadmap
3.	Release Planning
4.	Iteration Planning
a.	Definition of Done in the most detail
5.	Daily Planning
 ### Level of Detail
At each level, planning becomes more granular while overall it is big pictures.

---
# [Evolution of Product Scope](#evolution-of-product-scope)
## Story Map (Backbone)
The backbone of product development. It is a high-level understanding and how the user interacts with the system.
## Walking Skeleton
### Phases of Walking Skeleton
1.	Second level of the Story
2.	Minimum viable product
3.	End-to-end functionality
---

# [Definition of Done in Product Development](#definition-of-done-in-product-development)
## Product 
Defining Done allows the following:
1.	Realistic Expectations
2.	Strong Communication
3.	Differing Opinions
4.	Objective Criteria
5.	Gulf of Evaluation
6.	Wireframes and Prototypes
## Purpose of Product Vision
The purpose of the Product Vision defines the following:
1.	Why you are building the product
2.	Benefits the product will bring
3.	Who the product is built for
4.	Common Understanding
## Definition of Done Questions to Consider
1.	Are we making the right product?
2.	Are we making the product, right?
a.	Quality
b.	Benefits
c.	Value
### Acceptance Criteria
1.	Specific to the User Story
2.	Meets user needs
a.	Addresses need to be done
### Acceptance Criteria Prevents
#### Gold-Plating

Acceptance Criteria Prevents Gold-Plating. Gold-Plating is good intentions leading to problems.

# [Variations of Defining Done](#variations-of-defining-done)
## Done vs Potentially Releasable 
Done vs Potentially Releasable is an opportunity for continuous development.
## Potentially Releasable Products
Potentially Releasable Products are the following:
1.	Complete
2.	Tested
3.	Deliverable now
## Definition of Ready
Ready is a checklist and clarity. Definition of Ready should include the following:
1.	Backlog item is ready for the sprint
2.	INVEST criteria
3.	Work is identified
4.	Team capacity is known
5.	Tests and criteria are established

---

# [Creating a Definition of Done](#creating-a-definition-of-done)
## Is the work Done?
The team must reach a shared understanding of Done. Using sticky notes the team defines what is Done. The four phases for a team to determine What is Done are Brainstorming, sorting, and categorizing, Analysis and clarification, and lastly, Defining.
### Brainstorm
Generate Ideas
### Sort and categorize 
Customer Journey 
### Analysis and clarification
Affinity Diagram
### Define
Communicate Progress

## Why a clear Definition of Done?
A clear Definition of Done provides five instrumental things:
1.	Iterative effort
2.	Missing or incomplete work
3.	Poorly written Definition of Done
4.	Product increment is not potentially releasable
5.	Never or unfamiliar work

---

# [Definition of Done and the Sprint Goal](#definition-of-done-and-the-sprint-goal)
Defining Done prevents missed sprint goals and finds the root cause of analysis.
## Missing the Sprint Goal
Four reasons for missing the Sprint Goal
1.	Unclear product requirements
2.	Hidden work
3.	Incorrect estimates
4.	Lack of transparency
## Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective permits inspecting and adapting.

---
# [The Definition of Done and Empiricism](#the-definition-of-done-and-empiricism)
## Three Pillars of Empiricism (Scrum)
### Transparency
1.	Information and team members know what is going on in the project
### Inspection
1.	Inspect daily
a.	Burndown Chart
### Adaptation
1.	React quickly
2.	Sprint Retrospective
## Scrum Goals
By establishing sprint goals and assignments of User Stories, Kanban Stories, and Bugs each team member must adhere to their commitment. If a User Story, Kanban Story, or Bug is not completed within a sprint, it can be moved to next. Although you can move a story or bug to the next, it is imperative to complete items to prevent inconsistencies in a Burndown Chart.
### Commitment
Achieving the goals of the team

# [Course Summary](#course-summary)
The course Scrum and the Definition of Done provided five essential ideas:
1.	Evolution of the product scope
2.	Impact on product quality
3.	Steps to create a Definition of Done
4.	Relationship with the sprint goal

# [Conclusion](#conclusion)
I recommend anyone interested in learning software development or project management learn Scrum framework. In this *linguistic-written-works-of-artz {L.WWoA}* titled **Scrum Framework: The Definition of Done**, I provide a synopsis of my notes compiled while taking a course within refining Program Increment 16 of the Puerto Rico Disaster Recovery Project as a Software Engineer at Blue Streak Technologies.
<br/>

**Until next time:**  *clarifying your team’s definition of done will assist in completing user stories and achieving sprint goals.*
